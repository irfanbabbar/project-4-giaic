
# The Hangman game is another fun Python project that involves using concepts like dictionaries, lists, strings, and random modules. In this project, you will create a game where the user has to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters, and they have a limited number of guesses before they lose the game.

# Steps for Creating the Hangman Game:
# Choose a Word: The program will select a word from a list of possible words.
# Display the Word: The word will be displayed as underscores (_), with the number of underscores matching the number of letters in the word.
# Get User Guesses: The user will guess letters one at a time.
# Track Incorrect Guesses: If the guess is incorrect, the program will count the number of wrong guesses, and the user will lose the game after a set number of incorrect guesses.
# Check for Win or Loss: The game continues until the user guesses the word or runs out of guesses.import random

# List of possible words to guess
import random

# Explanation of the Code:
# Word List:

# word_list contains a list of words that the program will randomly choose from for the user to guess.
# You can modify the list to include your own words or add more.
# Selecting a Word:

# The word is randomly chosen using random.choice(word_list).
# Displaying the Word:

# The word is displayed as a series of underscores (_) initially, each representing a letter in the word. For example, if the word is "python", it will be displayed as ['_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_'].
# User Guess:

# The user is asked to guess a letter one at a time using input().
# The program checks if the guess is a valid single letter, and if the user has already guessed it.
# Incorrect Guesses:

# If the user's guess is incorrect, the program increases the count of incorrect_guesses and tells the user how many guesses they have left (the max allowed is 6).
# Update the Display:

# When the user guesses correctly, the program updates the guessed word by replacing the appropriate underscores with the guessed letter.
# End of Game:

# The game ends when the user either guesses the word correctly or runs out of incorrect guesses.
# If the user guesses the word, they win. If they run out of guesses, the game ends with a "Game Over" message and reveals the word.
